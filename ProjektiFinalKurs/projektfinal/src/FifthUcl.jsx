        <strong className="fs-1">O</strong>ne, two, three, four, FIVE!!!
        <strong> London, Paris, Rome, </strong>
        London again and now <strong>Berlin</strong> – FC Barcelona have beaten <strong>Juventus</strong> to win their fifth
        <strong> Champions League </strong>title (although the competition wasn’t known by that name when they won it for the first time).
        That means the Catalans now have one more than <strong>Ajax</strong>, and are now matched with <strong>Liverpool</strong> and
        <strong> Bayern Munich </strong>in the all-time table.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-primary fw-bold mt-5 mb-3">Five out of eight</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        So far, the 21st century has been wonderful for FCB, when four of the five titles were won (2006, 2009, 2011 and 2015). Until the turn of the century, the Catalans had only tasted success once, in 1992, when <strong>Koeman’s</strong> famous free kick at Wembley downed <strong>Sampdoria</strong> in extra time.
        Before that, Barça had lost two finals, to <strong>Benfica</strong> in Berne (1961) and to <strong>Steaua Bucharest</strong> in Seville (1986). The only other time Barça lost the final was to <strong>AC Milan</strong> in Athens (1994).

      <h3 className="text-primary fw-bold mt-5 mb-3">Club of the decade</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        In the 60-year history of the European Cup, only two teams now have more titles than Barça, <strong>Real Madrid</strong> (10) and <strong>AC Milan</strong> (7). But with four titles in the last decade, there is no doubt where the momentum lies. While Barça have won the trophy four times, no other side has done so more than once, with the other six titles shared by <strong>AC Milan, Manchester United, Inter Milan, Chelsea, Bayern Munich</strong> and <strong>Real Madrid</strong>.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        The Champions League also completes a historic treble after Barça won the domestic league and cup double as well. In fact, Barça have become the very first team to achieve that distinction not once, but twice! And if we count all of the other professional sports teams, FC Barcelona has now won an incredible 39 continental crowns.
