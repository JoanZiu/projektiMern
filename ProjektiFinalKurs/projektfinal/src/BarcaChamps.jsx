<p className="paragraph">Barça's Record in the UEFA Champions League</p>
<h3 className="mt-5 mb-4 text-uppercase fw-bold text-primary">How many times have Barça won the Champions League?</h3>
<p className="mb-4">
  Barça’s record in the Champions League is one of the best in all of Europe. Currently, Barça have won the competition on five occasions, a total that puts the blaugranes amongst the most successful clubs in the tournament with the Catalan club involved in several of the most memorable matches in the competition’s history.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
  The first success was long in the making until 1992, a time when the competition was still known as the UEFA European Cup. FC Barcelona claimed their first victory on a magical evening at Wembley Stadium in London. Since then, Barça have won it four more times in the 21st century (2006, 2009, 2011, 2015), thanks to a unique generation of players led by Leo Messi.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
  Despite unprecedented domestic success during this time, it has been Barça’s Champions League triumphs that earned global plaudits. Victories in the Champions League opened the door to other titles, including three FIFA Club World Cups and four UEFA Super Cups.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
  For that reason, the five trophies take pride of place in the Barça Stadium Tour & Museum, displayed in the trophy room alongside the Club’s other silverware. In short, they are the culmination of five magical seasons celebrated in this look at Barça’s Champions League success.
</p>

<h2 className="mt-5 mb-4 text-uppercase fw-bold text-primary">1991/92: Champions of Europe for the First Time</h2>
<p className="mb-4">
  The European Cup final victory in 1992 marked both the end of one era and the beginning of another. It was the final edition under the old knockout format, though a league system was used to decide the finalists.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
  It was Barça’s first European Cup triumph and the beginning of a golden age. Johan Cruyff’s ‘Dream Team’ reached the final after wins over Hansa Rostock, Kaiserslautern, Sparta Prague, Benfica, and Dynamo Kyiv.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
  The team brought fresh life to football with talents like Michael Laudrup, Pep Guardiola, and Hristo Stoichkov. Two players stood out: Jose Mari Bakero, whose injury-time goal vs. Kaiserslautern secured a place in the mini-league, and Ronald Koeman, whose unforgettable free-kick at Wembley gave Barça a 1-0 win over Sampdoria in extra time.
</p>

<h2 className="mt-5 mb-4 text-uppercase fw-bold text-primary">2005/06: The Peak of the Rijkaard Era</h2>
<p className="mb-4">
  Barça’s second Champions League title came under Dutch coach Frank Rijkaard. The team, centered around attacking play, featured Ronaldinho as the star, with young talents like Messi and Iniesta emerging. Xavi missed much of the season due to injury.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
  Barça topped a group with Werder Bremen, Udinese, and Panathinaikos. They then faced a tough Chelsea side in the round of 16, where Messi was injured. Wins against Benfica and AC Milan followed — the latter thanks to a Giuly goal from a Ronaldinho assist.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
  In the final against Arsenal in Paris, goals from Samuel Eto’o and Juliano Belletti in the second half turned the game around and earned Barça a 2-1 victory, with emotional celebrations at full time.
</p>

<h2 className="mt-5 mb-4 text-uppercase fw-bold text-primary">2008/09: Rounding Off the Sextuple</h2>
<p className="mb-4">
  In 2009, Barça won an unprecedented six trophies. Pep Guardiola’s first season as coach saw a peak generation — Messi, Xavi, Iniesta, Busquets, and Piqué — dominate the footballing world.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
  In the Champions League, Barça advanced past Sporting, Shakhtar, and Basel in the group stage. Olympique Lyon and Bayern Munich followed, with an unforgettable first half against Bayern at Camp Nou.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
  The semi-final against Chelsea was dramatic, decided by Andrés Iniesta’s iconic last-minute goal at Stamford Bridge. Barça then defeated Manchester United in Rome, with goals from Eto’o and Messi sealing a historic treble.
</p>

<h2 className="mt-5 mb-4 text-uppercase fw-bold text-primary">2010/11: Déjà Vu at Wembley</h2>
<p className="mb-4">
  Barça’s fourth title came in 2011, again under Guardiola. Reinforced by David Villa and Mascherano, the team was dominant throughout the competition.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
  Barça won their group ahead of Copenhagen, Rubin Kazan, and Panathinaikos, then eliminated Arsenal and Shakhtar. The semi-final against Real Madrid was intense, with Messi’s brace at the Bernabéu proving decisive.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
  In the final at Wembley — a repeat of 2009 — Barça once again beat Manchester United. Goals from Pedro, Villa, and Messi gave them a 3-1 victory and their fourth Champions League crown.
</p>

<h2 className="mt-5 mb-4 text-uppercase fw-bold text-primary">2014/15: A Treble for a Talented Front Three</h2>
<p className="mb-4">
  With Luis Enrique as coach, Barça won their second treble — the first club to do so twice. Messi, Suárez, and Neymar led the charge in a team full of talent and chemistry.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
  Barça won a tough group with PSG, Ajax, and APOEL. Manchester City and PSG again were beaten in the knockouts, before Bayern Munich — now led by Guardiola — stood in the way. Messi’s dazzling goal at Camp Nou secured their place in the final.
</p>
<p className="mb-4">
  In the Berlin final against Juventus, goals from Rakitic, Suárez, and Neymar gave Barça a 3-1 win. It was a perfect farewell for club legend Xavi Hernández, who lifted the trophy in his final game.
