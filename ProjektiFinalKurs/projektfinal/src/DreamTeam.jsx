      Barça win their first European Cup in 1992
        </h3>

      <p className="mb-4">
        From 1988 on, with Cruyff as manager, Barça came to be associated once more with
        excellent football and sporting success. The board of directors presided over by Josep
        Lluís Nuñez focused on building up a team of footballers that would spark enthusiasm
        and perform well. The Camp Nou began to fill up once again.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        FC Barcelona managed to secure four consecutive Spanish League championships, between
        1990 and 1994. Winning the European Cup in 1992 was the pinnacle of this period, which
        was characterised by the team’s one touch play and attacking style and the winning
        mentality of Cruyff’s players.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Known as the 'Dream Team' of European football, the following unforgettable players went
        down in the Club’s history: Zubizarreta, Bakero, Begiristain, Laudrup, Koeman,
        Stoichkov, Romário, Eusebio, Nadal, Guardiola, Amor, Juan Carlos, Ferrer, Nando, Julio
        Salinas, Serna, Alexanko and Goikoetxea.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Led by the Cruyff-Rexach duo, the team finally drew a line under its troubled past; Barça
        became one of the biggest names in world football.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-5 mb-4 text-uppercase fw-bold text-primary">The Return of Cruyff</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        “I know the Club and I don’t want history to repeat itself. If we want things to change,
        we must change history”. These words set the Cruyff era in motion, marked by a change of
        philosophy. The team’s tactics were modified to incorporate the Dutch coach Rinus
        Michels’s “total football”. Team management also changed, becoming the exclusive
        responsibility of the manager.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        With Cruyff, Barça experienced a glorious era. Cruyff’s track record includes one European
        Cup, four Spanish League championships, one Cup Winners’ Cup, one Copa del Rey and four
        Spanish Supercups. He was also responsible for introducing “rondos” into the team’s
        training sessions.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-5 mb-4 text-uppercase fw-bold text-primary">Third European Cup Winners' Cup</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        On 10 May 1989, goals from Salinas and López Rekarte led FC Barcelona to a 2-0 victory
        against UC Sampdoria of Genoa. Over 25,000 supporters travelled to Switzerland to support
        the team. Cruyff’s new Barça took home the Club’s third Cup Winners’ Cup.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        After years of disillusionment, fans returned to Canaletes and Plaça Sant Jaume to
        celebrate the top football team’s victory.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-5 mb-4 text-uppercase fw-bold text-primary">Migueli's Farewell</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Migueli holds a privileged place in the history of the club, being the second player who
        has worn the Barça shirt most times (553), only beaten by Xavi. He was also one of the
        best centre backs to have ever played for FC Barcelona. On 5 September 1989, 'Migueli'
        wore the Barça colours for the last time in a match when Barça beat the Bulgarian
        national football team. Migueli played for FC Barcelona for the final time after sixteen
        seasons, alongside legendary figures like Cruyff (who scored a goal) and Rexach.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-5 mb-4 text-uppercase fw-bold text-primary">First European Cup in Handball</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Barça’s handball team won its first EHF Champions League while under Valero Rivera’s
        management. FC Barcelona beat FK Proleter Zrenjanin 20-17 before a capacity crowd at the
        Palau. The combination of veteran players, like Rico, Sagalés and Serrano, and promising
        young players, such as Masip, Urdangarín and Barrufet, alongside the best player in the
        world, Veselin Vujović, brought the desired results.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Barça’s European domination began here, with a team that is one of the main favourites to
        win titles, year after year.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-5 mb-4 text-uppercase fw-bold text-primary">... And in Football</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The dream became a reality on 20 May 1992 at Wembley Stadium in London, when Barça beat
        UC Sampdoria of Genoa. The course of FC Barcelona’s history changed forever. Johan
        Cruyff’s last instruction to his players before they stepped onto the pitch was: “Go out
        and enjoy it”.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        The match went to extra time after a scoreless draw. In the 111th minute, Ronald Koeman’s
        brilliant free kick clinched Barça’s first European Cup victory. 25,000 supporters
        accompanied the team to Wembley. One million people turned out on the streets of
        Barcelona to welcome the European champions home.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-5 mb-4 text-uppercase fw-bold text-primary">Four Consecutive League Titles</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The Spanish League was the only title Cruyff had left to win, having already won the Cup
        Winners’ Cup (1989) and the Copa del Rey (1990). Barça rose to the occasion. Not only did
        it win the League — it won four Leagues in a row (1991, 1992, 1993, 1994). The last three
        were won in the last match of the season.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        To this day, one of the abiding images of the 'Dream Team' is that of the footballers on
        the pitch awaiting the outcomes of their rivals’ matches. Unfortunately, the run of
        league title wins came to an end over the next two seasons.
